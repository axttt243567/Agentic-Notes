# agentic-notes-flutter

A Flutter-based app prototype featuring an agentic system for creating and organizing academic/self-study notes. The agent generates aesthetic PDF notes (text + images) while helping users track learning goals, progress, and study organization. This MVP demonstrates agentic workflows, memory, and goal-tracking in a student-focused note-making assistant.
