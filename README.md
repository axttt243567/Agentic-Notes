# Agentic-Notes

Flutter prototype of an AI-agent note assistant that auto-builds aesthetic PDFs from your study content, embeds images, remembers context, and tracks goals & progress. Shows agentic workflows, memory management, and student-centric organization in an MVP.

This Flutter app demonstrates an agentic system for creating and organizing academic/self-study notes. The agent generates aesthetic PDF notes (text + images) while helping track learning goals, progress, and study organization.
